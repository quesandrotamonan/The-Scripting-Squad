# Shopping Online

Is simply the buying and selling of goods using the internet, when shopping online. However, the term is often used to describe all of a sellerâ€™s efforts, when selling products directly to consumers. It starts when a potential customer learns about a product and continues through purchase, use, and, ideally, ongoing customer loyalty.
